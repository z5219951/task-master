Week 1
Group formed. All group members have chosen and agreed to doing Task Master for the project. Following our weekly 
meeting, it was decided that Yue Qi and I will be working on the frontend of the project. We have chosen Reactjs
as our programming language of choice.

Week 2
Initialised React frontend on Git and created a simple navbar with routes for the home, login and register page.

Week 3
Added on to storyboards created by Yue Qi. I separated Yue Qi's storyboard into chunks and added more detail to each one.
Also written descriptions to those storyboards. Added a couple of user stories and acceptance criteria on Jira.

Week 4
Implemented the front end for the taskboard, a task creation page, a profile page and an update profile page covering user stories 
cwc-51, cwc-68, cwc-39, and cwc-40.
